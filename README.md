Ifeel computers & associated languages are taking over huan beings manual labor jobs.
To be viable in the future a perso either be able to tell machines what and how to
do a task or procedure.  Or the human being will have to be a highly sophisticated
"mechanic" of those machines.  TO BE OR NOT TO BE is the question!!
